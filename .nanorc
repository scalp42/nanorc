## searches.  They cannot contain blank characters.  The former set must
## come before the latter set, and both must be in the same order.
##
set matchbrackets "(<[{)>]}"

## Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled,
## mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a
## double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X
## Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.
##
# set mouse

## Do case sensitive searches by default.
# set casesensitive

## Use auto-indentation
# set autoindent

## Backup files to filename~
# set backup

## Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.
set constantshow

## Do quick statusbar blanking.  Statusbar messages will disappear after
## 1 keystroke instead of 26.  Note that "const" overrides this.
##
# set quickblank

# set noconvert

## Set the line length for wrapping text and justifying paragraphs.
## If fill is negative, the line length will be the screen width less
## this number.
##
# set fill -8

## Don't wrap text at all
# set nowrap

## Set operating directory.  nano will not read or write files outside
## this directory and its subdirectories.  Also, the current directory
## is changed to here, so files are inserted from this dir.  A blank
## string means the operating directory feature is turned off.
##
# set operatingdir ""
